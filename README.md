# Betterment

## Overview and Origin

Betterment is a financial advisory company which provides funds management services for a variety of clients which includes three areas of business; being retail investment, an advisory platform and a defined-contribution product for business with over US$30 billion in funds under management. The company was founded in 2008 by Jon Stein ad Eli Broverman. The company was incorporated as Betterment, LLC in April 2009. The idea of the company came from wanting to change the idea that "is isn't ought" and what is currently being done need not be the case in the future, with the aim of helping people in their investment decisions. Jonathan Stein wanted to change his own poor investing behaviour along with others facing wasted time, taxes and transaction costs which are involved in actively, manually managing their own portfolio through a service that could do it all. Betterment was the first company to launch a robo-advisor in 2010.
Betterment has received funding totalling US$435 million from various funds and investors, receiving equity and debt financing from 26 different investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, Kinnevik and Citi Ventures.


## Business Activities:

Betterment has been looking to make investing more accessible and easy to use for people, with personalised automated investing solutions for individuals depending on their needs. Betterment's retail option is designed for anyone looking to invest, whilst their their platform for advisors and 401(k) products (defined benefit) are for financial advisors and small to medium sized businesses with a defined-benefit scheme. 

Betterment offers services that are tailored towards the needs of younger professionals who want to make sense of investing. The main points of differentiation compared to other robo advisors is that there is no minimum balance requirement along with the option to construct a tailored low-cost socially responsible portfolio which other robo advisors do not offer. Betterment also offers tax-loss harvesting for free, 

To construct their robo-advisory service (non-cryptocurrency), Betterment use two different mathematical models averaged together rather than classical AI and machine learning techniques. The first model is based on Monte Carlo simulations creating optimal portfolio allocations through scenario analysis. The other is based on the Black-Litterman model, which acts as a portfolio allocation framework which is derived from modern portfolio theory. Although no machine learning is directly used in deriving portfolio allocations for customers, the technology is employed in some of their offerings. For example as part of their advisory service, machine learning was used to calculate the expected returns and volatility of their onboarded exchange-traded funds (ETF's) to assist their advisor clients in advising their own clients. For Betterment's cryptocurrency investment offering, the company uses clusterning machine learning methods for portfolio construction due to scantily available data for the upcoming field.

## Landscape:

Betterment is in the robo advisory domain of the financial industry. The robo advisory domain has changed since then, with a larger array of options and types of robo advisors becoming available. The first robo-advisors (Robo-Advisor 1.0) available (including Betterment's) involved clients receiving a single proposal/recommendation or portfolio allocation based on listed investment products from a questionnaire which acted as a filter, with products including stocks, bonds and ETF's. In 2014 an updated form of robo-advisors (2.0) was launched, with fund-of fund investment portfolios offered, with robo advisors offering to set up investment accounts and undertake direct order execution. This marked a shift from robo advisors being purely advisory to executory with portfolio managers still managing asset allocation. In March 2016, robo advisor 3.0 was launched. This involved further automation, with investment decisions and rebalancing being automated subject to a set of pre-determined investment criteria with final oversight from portfolio fund managers. Robo advisor 4.0 was introduced in 2018 which involves direct investments being made by AI algorithms based on changing market conditions with little to no human intervention required.Betterment's competitors include Vanguard Digital Advisor, Schwab intelligent portofolios and Wealthfront


## Results

Betterment was an initial market mover/disrupter, successfully providing the first robo advisory service ever. Whilst it was disruptive initially, the methods that have been employed have been more classical mathematical models rather than machine learning and AI after conducting research on investment strategies employing machine learning and AI. The primary metrics used by companies in this domain to measure success are FUM ("Funds Under Management"), capital raised and returns of their robo advisors. Betterment has US$36 billion in FUM, being the fourth largest in its domain and has raised over US$400 million in capital from investors. The returns of Betterment are currently at 9.1% p.a since inception assuming a 100% portoflio of stocks (0% bonds), which is lower than most active listed benchmarks.


## Recommendations

I would recommend Betterment considers combining their two offerings of a crypto investment service and classical retail investment service into a third option with a split between both. Most young professional prospective investors might be interested in entering the crypto space as part of a balanced portfolio, balancing the desire to enter the space with classical investment return and risk constraints from a more standard portfolio. By combining their two crypto and non-crypto offerings into a single, easily managed portfolio, Betterment could attract a larger number of customers who might be hesitant to the two initial offerings. 
This would require either more intensive classical mathematical models and software systems or the use of AI to combine the AI-generated crypto portfolio and the Monte Carlo based classical portfolio.
These technologies would be appropriate due to the larger complexity of the data.
